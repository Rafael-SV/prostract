# Protein structure abstraction for machine learning
## Proteins are complex polymers, with vast dimesionality
### This project aims to reduce the dimensionality of proteins to make machine learning tractable. 

This folder contains descriptive notebooks in ./notebooks (currently python code is in the notebooks, it will be added to ./src later) , every .PDB file from the RCSB protein databank in the ./pdb_files directory, external code repos (such as pdbfixer and openMM) in ./external
