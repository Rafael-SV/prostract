# Protein structure abstraction for machine learning
## Proteins are complex polymers, with vast dimesionality
### This project aims to reduce the dimensionality of proteins to make machine learning tractable. 

This folder contains python code in ./scr , descriptive notebooks in ./notebooks , every .PDB file from the RCSB protein databank in the ./pdb_files directory, external code repos (such as pdbfixer and openMM) in ./external
